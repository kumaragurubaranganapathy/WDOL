Our records show that your electronic check in the amount of ${!Renewal_Application__c.Total_Balance__c} was returned marked nonsufficient funds.  Pursuant to s. 20.905 (2), you are also liable for a $20  dishonored check charge.


Since the check which you submitted was not honored, the license issued is subject to cancellation.  Pending receipt of full payment, department records will show that you are not currently licensed.  To obtain your license, you must pay the ${!Renewal_Application__c.Total_Balance__c} renewal fee and the $20 NSF Fee.


You may pay these fees on the eSLA portal at https://eSLA.wi.gov using a credit card by logging in to the portal and accessing your cart in the upper right corner of the screen.
