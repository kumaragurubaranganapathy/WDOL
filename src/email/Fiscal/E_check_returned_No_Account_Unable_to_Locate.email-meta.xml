Our records show that your electronic check in the amount of {!MUSW__License2__c.MUSW__Total_Balance__c} was returned marked No Account/Unable to Locate/Invalid Account.



Since the check which you submitted was not honored, the application which you submitted will not be processed.  To obtain your license, you must pay the {!MUSW__License2__c.MUSW__Total_Balance__c} application fee.


You may pay these fees on the eSLA portal at https://eSLA.wi.gov  using a credit card by logging in to the portal and accessing your cart in the upper right corner of the screen.
