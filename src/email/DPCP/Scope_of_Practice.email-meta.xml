Dear {!MUSW__License2__c.Applicant_Full_Name__c},

Credential holders are responsible for their own professional practice and for compliance with the law. The Department is unable to answer questions regarding:

Billing issues
Business advice
Employer/employee disputes
Legal opinions
Potential or ongoing litigation
Questions involving professional judgment or discretion
Scope of practice

The Department’s website provides a wide range of Online Services and materials to assist Industry, credential holders, and the public with questions about the practice of the various professions. These materials include the relevant Wisconsin Statutes, Wisconsin Administrative Code, meeting minutes, forms, and answers to frequently asked questions. The address for the Department’s website is http://dsps.wi.gov.

If you need to know which trades credentials an individual or business must hold in order to do certain types of work, please see https://dsps.wi.gov/pages/Professions. Consult the relevant application forms for links to state statutes and code in order to determine which forms to submit.

But if you are looking for information about Industry Services plan review, inspections, technical publications and forms, etc., please see – https://dsps.wi.gov/Pages/Programs.



Thank you,
