Re: Credential ID: {!MUSW__License2__c.Name}

Application for {!MUSW__License2__c.Credential__c}


The Department has reviewed the application for the credential specified above. The application cannot be processed until we receive the item(s) indicated below:


Ensure that the Certificate of Liability Insurance shows the following as the certificate holder:


o Department of Safety and Professional Services, 4822 Madison Yards Way, Madison, WI 53705


Have your insurance agent add the certificate holder information and submit a new certificate.  Writing this information into the “Certificate Holder” portion of your certificate of insurance is not acceptable.



Upload your correct insurance certificate to your eSLA portal dashboard. If you have any follow up questions, email us at dspscredtrades@wisconsin.gov


If a response is not received within 90 days, the review of your application will be discontinued and you will need to reapply for the credential.  If you have additional questions, contact the Trades Credentialing Unit.</textOnly>
