Dear {!MUSW__License2__c.Applicant_Full_Name__c},

In order for continuing education to count for your credential type, it has to have been pre-approved by the DSPS Office of Exams and Education, prior to you taking to course.  The course provider would have been assigned a DSPS Provider ID # and Course ID # and would know how to submit your attendance into our online system on your behalf using your credential number.  Please verify with the provider.
You can find a list of some pre-approved courses at - https://dsps.wi.gov/Pages/Professions/TradesContinuingEducation.aspx


Thank you,
The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services</textOnly>
