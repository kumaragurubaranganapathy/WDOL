Dear {!MUSW__License2__c.Applicant_Full_Name__c},

In order to pull permits to do work on one- or two-family homes, you need both the Dwelling Contractor certification and at least one person from the company needs the Dwelling Contractor Qualifier certification.  The Dwelling Contractor is a business license – it requires proof of financial responsibility (see application form). The Dwelling Contractor Qualifier is an individual license – it requires completion of a pre-credential “Initial Qualifier” course and then 12 hours of continuing education every two years.
These applications can be applied for and maintained via the eSLA portal.
If you are not doing work on one- or two-family homes (such as commercial or industrial work), or you are doing work that does not require you to pull building permits, the state does not require a license for that type of work, but you would still need to comply with any license requirements at the local level.
Please note that the above information only applies to general construction work; if you are an electrical, elevator, fire sprinkler, HVAC, or plumbing contractor, different licensing requirements apply - https://dsps.wi.gov/pages/Professions

Thank you,
