Dear {!MUSW__License2__c.Applicant_Full_Name__c},

Building Contractor
This credential number corresponds with the Building Contractor Registration, which was eliminated by an act of the state legislature in July of 2013. You can no longer renew this credential.
In order to pull permits to do work on one- or two-family homes, you need both the Dwelling Contractor certification and at least one person from the company needs the Dwelling Contractor Qualifier certification.  The Dwelling Contractor is a business license – it requires proof of financial responsibility (see application form). The Dwelling Contractor Qualifier is an individual license – it requires completion of a pre-credential “Initial Qualifier” course and then 12 hours of continuing education every two years.
These applications can be applied for and maintained via the eSLA portal.
If you are not doing work on one- or two-family homes (such as commercial or industrial work), or you are doing work that does not require you to pull building permits, the state does not require a license for that type of work, but you would still need to comply with any license requirements at the local level.
Please note that the above information only applies to general construction work; if you are an electrical, elevator, fire sprinkler, HVAC, or plumbing contractor, different licensing requirements apply - https://dsps.wi.gov/pages/Professions
PECFA (Petroleum Environmental Cleanup Fund Award)
The Department of Safety and Professional Services no longer issues or renews PECFA credentials.  Please contact the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for details on credential status, application, or renewal.  You may find PECFA contacts for the DNR at http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/brownfields/pecfa.html
Refrigerant Handling Technician
The Refrigerant Handling Technician certification was eliminated by an act of the State Legislature in 2012, so the Department of Safety and Professional Services no longer issues Refrigerant Handling Technician licenses, and it is not something that you can renew.
Please be aware that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources still regulates the transport or salvage of refrigeration or air-conditioning equipment – for more information, see http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/AirQuality/Refrigerants.html.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also regulates refrigerant sales, distribution and reclamation - for more information, call the Federal EPA office - https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/mailing-addresses-and-phone-numbers.

Thank you,

The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services</textOnly>
