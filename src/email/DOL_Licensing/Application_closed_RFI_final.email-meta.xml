    <subject>Department of Licensing - We have closed your {!MUSW__License2__c.Credential_Type__c} license application.</subject>
    <textOnly>We’ve closed your {!MUSW__License2__c.Credential_Type__c} license application.

We asked you for information or documents on {!MUSW__License2__c.RFI_Send_Date__c} and again on {!MUSW__License2__c.RFI_Send_Date_2nd__c}.

We didn’t receive it so we have closed your application.

If you want to get a license you must submit a new application with a new payment at {!MUSW__License2__c.Portal_URL__c}.
