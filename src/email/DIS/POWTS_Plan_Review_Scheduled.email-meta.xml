Review Appointment Confirmation


This letter serves as a confirmation of your review appointment on [Review Date].



Please use it in lieu of the traditional plan review application form when submitting your plans. To do so, complete all missing information, correct any inaccurate pre-printed information with red ink, and submit with your plans and appropriate fees.



Plan reviews may only be invoiced to the designer as an individual.  Designer shall sign the block on the first page to authorize invoicing. If you are paying by check for a paper submittal, please send your check along with this confirmation letter directly to the assigned office of the review.



If the plan you submit is not the same as indicated on the following pages, you will be at risk of having your plan appointment rejected and will have to reschedule using the correct information.  Plans must be in our office two days prior to your review appointment.  If you cancel at least two days prior to your appointment, that time can be utilized by another customer.  A $60 Missed Appointment fee may be charged for plans received late without proper cancelation notice.



If You Need To Contact Us To Cancel, Reschedule, Or Correct Information:

Please let us know via email to DspsSbPlanSchedule@wi.gov  as soon as possible



If You Are Requesting A Permission To Start:

Provide the owner&apos;s signature at the end of this form.



To Save Shipping Costs:

You are encouraged to submit 1 properly signed and sealed full plan set and 3 appropriately signed and sealed index sheets in lieu of the minimum 4 plan sets.



To Monitor The Continued Status Of Your Plan:


Plans status can be readily checked on our Internet site at http://www.dsps.wi.gov/Plan-Review/Plan-Status. You will need your designer Industry Services customer ID # to retrieve the plan information.
