	<aura:description>A dynamic lookup component that supports typealong-style functionality. To use, must either provide the sObject being referenced by this lookup field OR the object name and relevant field name that has the lookup field. In order for a parent component to be notified of changes, this component fires two events, updateLookupIdEvent and clearLookupIdEvent. See those events for more details about their parameters. To customize the icon used by this component, you can specify an icon by its name (for example, standard:account or custom:custom31).</aura:description>
